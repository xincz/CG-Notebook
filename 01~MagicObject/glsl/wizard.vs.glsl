// The shared variable is initialized in the vertex shader and attached to the current vertex being processed,
// such that each vertex is given a shared variable and when passed to the fragment shader,
// these values are interpolated between vertices and across fragments,
// below we can see the shared variable is initialized in the vertex shader using the 'out' classifier

    // and finally the projection matrix to get final vertex position
