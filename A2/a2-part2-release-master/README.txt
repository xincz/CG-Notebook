Hotkeys and my additions:
Now you can control the position of the upper body of the skinningArmadillo:
T, Y to rotate the upper body along X axis
U, I to rotate the upper body along Y axis
O, P to rotate the upper body along Z axis

I also kinda modified the position for the head vertices, so that the bottom of the 
face is included, and there would be no weird protrusions when nodding the head.
